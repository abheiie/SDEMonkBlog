# Overview

## What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain **data** (attributes) and **code** (methods).

Instead of writing procedures and functions, OOP organizes code into reusable structures that model real-world entities.

## Why use OOP?

- Encourages **modularity** through encapsulation
- Promotes **code reusability** via inheritance
- Improves **maintainability** and **scalability**
- Simplifies **refactoring** and **extending** applications
- Helps you **model complex systems** using real-world analogies

## Key OOP Concepts:
We will now explore the 4 fundamental principles of OOP one-by-one:
1. **Encapsulation**
