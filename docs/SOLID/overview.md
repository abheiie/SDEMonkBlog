# Overview 

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help software developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software systems. The principles are:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing behavior to be added without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use, promoting the use of smaller, more specific interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
