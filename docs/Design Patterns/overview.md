# Overview

## What are Design Patterns?

**Design Patterns** are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a shared vocabulary and best practices that help developers build **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **flexible** software systems.

These patterns are not code templates, but **general reusable solutions** to recurring design challenges in object-oriented programming.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are commonly classified into three main categories:

### Creational Patterns
> Focus on how objects are **created**. They abstract the instantiation process and help make a system independent of how its objects are constructed.

Examples:  
- [Singleton](./singleton)  
- [Factory Method](./factory-method)  
- [Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory)  
- [Builder](./builder)  
- [Prototype](./prototype)

---

### Structural Patterns
> Deal with how classes and objects are **composed** to form larger structures, promoting code reusability and flexibility.

Examples:  
- Adapter  
- Bridge  
- Composite  
- Decorator  
- Facade  
- Flyweight  
- Proxy

---

### Behavioral Patterns
> Focus on how objects **interact and communicate**, distributing responsibility and improving flexibility in control flow.

Examples:  
- Observer  
- Strategy  
- Command  
- State  
- Iterator  
- Mediator  
- Visitor  
- Template Method  
- Chain of Responsibility  
- Memento  
- Interpreter

## Why Use Design Patterns?

✅ Speeds up development using proven solutions  
✅ Improves code readability and communication  
✅ Encourages best practices and object-oriented design principles  
✅ Makes systems easier to extend and maintain

> **Tip**: Design patterns are **tools, not rules**. Use them when they make your code cleaner and more robust — not just for the sake of using them.
