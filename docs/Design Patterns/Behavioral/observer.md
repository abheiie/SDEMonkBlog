# Observer

The **Observer Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** where an object (the **Subject**) maintains a list of dependents (called **Observers**) and notifies them of state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

---

## ðŸ”¶ Real-world Analogy

Imagine a **weather station**. It tracks changes in temperature and humidity. Devices like displays and delivery platforms (e.g., Zomato) subscribe to it. When the weather changes, they get notified and act accordingly.

---

## âœ… Purpose

- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- When one object changes state, all its dependents are automatically updated.

---

## ðŸ”§ Structure

```text
+-------------------+        +------------------+
|     Subject       |<-------|    Observer      |
+-------------------+        +------------------+
| + register()      |        | + update()       |
| + unregister()    |        +------------------+
| + notify()        |
+-------------------+
         |
         v
Notifies all registered observers
```

## Components
1. Subject â€“ Maintains a list of observers and notifies them.
2. Observer â€“ Defines the interface to receive updates.
3. ConcreteSubject â€“ Holds the state and implements the notification logic.
4. ConcreteObserver â€“ Implements the update() method to react to changes.

# Example in Python

**Observer Interface**

```Python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, temp: int, humidity: int):
        pass

    def registerSubject(self, subject: Subject):
        subject.register(self)

    def unregisterSubject(self, subject: Subject):
        subject.unregister(self)

```

**Concrete Observers**
```Python

class Display(Observer):
    def update(self, temp, humidity):
        print(f"Temp: {temp}, Humidity: {humidity} from display")

class Zomato(Observer):
    def update(self, temp, hum):
        if hum > 20:
            print("Zomato updated price of delivery..")
        else:
            print("Zomato already increased delivery price due to humidity..")

        if temp > 30:
            print("Zomato updated price of delivery..")
```


**Subject Class**
```Python
from typing import List

class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers: list[Observer] = []

    def register(self, observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)

    def unregister(self, observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self, temp, hum):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update(temp, hum)
```
ðŸ”¸ Concrete Subject: WeatherStation

```Python
from subjects.subject import Subject

class WeatherStation(Subject):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.temp = 0
        self.humidity = 0

    def updateWeather(self, temp, hum):
        self.temp = temp
        self.humidity = hum
        self.notify(temp, hum)
```

Client Code

```Python
station = WeatherStation()

display = Display()
zomato = Zomato()

display.registerSubject(station)
zomato.registerSubject(station)

station.updateWeather(32, 25)

# Output:
# Temp: 32, Humidity: 25 from display
# Zomato updated price of delivery..
# Zomato updated price of delivery..
```


**Benefits**
1. Promotes loose coupling between subject and observers.
2. Makes it easy to add or remove observers.
3. Ideal for event-driven or reactive systems.

ðŸš« When Not to Use
1. When you have too many observers â€” can lead to performance issues.
2. When the order of notification matters but isnâ€™t guaranteed.

Summary
1. Observer Pattern is useful for broadcasting state changes.
2. Widely used in GUIs, logging, event systems, pub-sub architectures.

ðŸ§¾ Related Patterns
1. Mediator: Controls complex communication between objects.
2. Publish-Subscribe: Observer with more decoupling using event buses.
