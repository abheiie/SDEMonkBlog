# Overview 
The **Behavioral Design Patterns** focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. They help in defining clear communication patterns between objects, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

## Common Behavioral Patterns
1. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
2. **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
3. **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
4. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
